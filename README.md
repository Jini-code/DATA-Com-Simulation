### 1. [Datacom Cybersecurity Job Simulation] https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo/blob/main/path/to/your/file/Datacom_completion_certificate.pdf
*Aug 2024 â€“ Sep 2024*

**Overview**:  
As part of this cybersecurity job simulation, I was tasked with analyzing a simulated cyberattack to evaluate the security posture of a client organization. This simulation was designed to mimic real-world security threats, including network intrusions, data breaches, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). My role involved performing a thorough security analysis of the organizationâ€™s infrastructure, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and proposing effective solutions to mitigate the risks.

During the simulation, I worked closely with Datacom's cybersecurity team to assess the attack vectors, analyze log data, and identify system weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. I conducted vulnerability assessments using industry-standard tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Nessus to detect security gaps, and developed a comprehensive report that detailed the findings. The report included prioritized recommendations for improving the organization's security protocols, strengthening its defense mechanisms, and ensuring better threat detection and response capabilities.

Key actions included:
- **Threat Detection**: Identifying and categorizing potential attack vectors within the organization's network and systems.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Using tools like Nmap and Nessus to scan and identify weak spots that could be targeted by cybercriminals.
- **Incident Response Strategy**: Developing an incident response plan with clear actions to be taken in the event of a breach, including containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
- **Recommendations**: Proposing concrete actions to harden the security posture, such as patch management, improved network segmentation, and enhanced security monitoring.
- **Collaboration**: Working with a cross-functional cybersecurity team to validate findings and fine-tune mitigation strategies, ensuring alignment with industry best practices and client requirements.

This hands-on project provided valuable experience in threat detection, vulnerability management, and the real-time application of cybersecurity protocols, which enhanced my ability to safeguard systems from evolving cyber threats.

- Analyzed a simulated cyberattack, delivering actionable recommendations and a detailed report to improve cybersecurity posture.
- Collaborated with Datacom's cybersecurity team to evaluate threats, diagnose vulnerabilities, and develop targeted mitigation strategies to safeguard client systems.
